# 🐍 Snake Game – Python + Pygame

This repository contains a classic **Snake Game** developed using Python and the **Pygame** library.  
The project was created as part of the **Python Developer Internship** at **NovaNectar Services Pvt. Ltd.**

## 🎮 About the Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves across the screen to eat food items. Each time the snake eats, it grows in length and the score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself. This version of the game is built using Python and Pygame, featuring real-time collision detection, smooth movement, score tracking, and game-over conditions.
